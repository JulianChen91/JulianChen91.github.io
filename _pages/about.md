Howdy! Welcome to my blog. My name is Juxian (or call me Julian). I’m a data scientist with a concentration on natural language processing. I also have a broad interest in machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning. This blog is mainly used for sharing my thoughts of machine learning. All comments are appreciated. Have a nice trip.

Education
======
Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI), Worcester, MA, May 2016

**Master of Science in Financial Mathematics, GPA 3.45/4.0**

University of Indianapolis, Indianapolis, IN, Dec. 2013

**Bachelor of Arts in International Business, Minor in Mathematics, GPA 3.658/4.0**

Work experience
======
* **Data Scientist Intern**, SFL Scientific, MA, Nov. 2016- Recent
  * Participated in drafting Algorithmic Trading System Architecture and designing back-testing environment.
  * Associated in feature engineering, model selection and model ensembling for NLP projects.
* **Data Analyst Intern**, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), Ningbo, May 2015-Aug 2015
  * Utilized credit card payments data for merchants to provide data visualization and insights back to them. 
  * Applied various machine learning algorithms and predictive models to investigate credit card authorization failure, detect patterns and recommend solutions. 

Projects
======
* **Website Content Classification [NLP project in Python]**, SFL Scientific, Feb. 2017- Mar. 2017
  * Applied tree ensemble models to classify website content by topics using a bag-of-word approach.
  * Built a pipeline for data text preprocessing, feature extraction and model selection for multi-label classification.
* **Drug Description Classification [NLP project in Python]**, SFL Scientific, Nov. 2016- Jan. 2017
  * Generated features based on part of speech(PoS) position, sentences position and a first order features generated from unigram, bigrams and trigrams, perceptron and Hidden Markov model for multi-label classification. 
  * Applied ROC curve as chosen measurement for cutoff value for unbalanced dataset. 
* **Data Mining Competition [ML project in Python]**, Rang Technologies and KVRA tech, May 2016- Jun. 2016
  * Predicted if customers are satisfied or dissatisfied with their banking experience by applying preprocessing steps such as replacing NA, dropping sparse and duplicated features, normalization. Generated new features before the model trained. 
  * Build several XGB boosting and random forest models with different feature set and parameters. Obtained the best result by ensembling classifiers with a weight voting. The weights are found through grid search with cross validation.
* **Portfolio Risk Analysis [Time Series Analysis in R]**, WPI, Oct. 2015- Nov. 2015
  * Applied R to calculate the daily predicted volatilities from GARCH model and build a mathematical model for the daily value changes of the portfolio that is valid for any permissible portfolio composition. 
  * Fitted separate marginal distributions to the returns of the stocks and identified the copula that connects the marginal distributions. Utilized this model to evaluate the risks in terms of the VaR of the worst-case scenario. 

Awards
======
* **Data Mining/Data Science Competition Top 20%of Participants**, Rang Technologies and KVRA tech   Jun. 2016

Skills
======
* Python, Matlab, R, C++, Java, MySQL, Hadoop
