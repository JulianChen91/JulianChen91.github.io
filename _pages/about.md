Howdy! Welcome to my blog. My name is Juxian (or call me Julian). Iâ€™m a data scientist with a concentration on natural language processing. I also have a broad interest in machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning. This blog is mainly used for sharing my thoughts of machine learning. All comments are appreciated. Have a nice trip.
